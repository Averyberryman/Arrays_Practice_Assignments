1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

- I feel pretty good about arrays, I was having some difficulty in Replit but I rebooted the program and it started working for me.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

- I think I want to know why certain commands work in the embedded replit we had in the lesson but didn't work on the Replit site itself, but it could have been an issue of syntax that I missed.

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?

- How many methods are there? When do we know which to use?
